* Problem statement
*ADT  SortedList – Implementation  on  a  hash  table,  collision  resolution  by  separate chaining.*

By 2020, China plans to assign each of its 1.4 billion citizens a "social credit score" that will determine what people are allowed to do, and where they rank in society. 

It's part of a broad effort in China to build a so-called reputation system that will measure, in theory, the credibility of government officials and businesses, in addition to citizens. The Chinese government says the system will boost "trust" nationwide and build a culture of "sincerity."

Since we are dealing with a huge data set we need fast inserts, fast look-ups, and some way to keep storage space low. We also want to sort the data set according to each citizens score. For managing this huge undertaking I chose a Sorted list with a hash table as an implementation.
